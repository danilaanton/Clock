## Features
- **Displaying Time:**

The time is displayed both using a typical digital clock, but also an analog clock in the background of the main screen. These values are updated every second in order to stay accurate.

- **Timer:**
The timer is used to measure a specific time interval, counting down from the time set by the user to 0. Selecting the time is done by scrolling through the items in the time picker and adding the alarm is done by pressing the add button.
The user can select the time, pause/resume the countdown and reset the timer to 0.

- **Chronometer:**
The chronometer measures the time passed since its activation in hours, minutes, seconds, and centiseconds.  
Just like the timer, it can be paused, resumed, and reset. In addition to that, the user can also save laps while the chronometer is running.

- **Alarm Clock:**
Using the alarm clock, an alert can be set for a given time. This alert can be scheduled to activate every time on a specific day of the week, or it can be activated only once and be discarded afterwards. The user can snooze alarms, with a snoozing timeframe of 5 minutes.
The alerts can also be viewed and cancelled.

- **Calendar:**
The calendar is used to identify the days within the month of a specific year. Aside from visualizing dates, the calendar can also be used for setting reminders for future events. The date can be selected, as well as the time.
Calendar reminders also have a snooze and a cancel option, just like the alarm clock.
